## Tool Utilization Guidelines:

1. Upon Local Hosting:
   - Start by hosting the tool locally.
   - You can upload an image by selecting the "Upload Image" option.
   - Alternatively, capture an image using your camera via the "Take Image" button.

2. Image Preview:
   - Preview the uploaded or captured image before proceeding further.
   - Ensure the image meets your expectations.

3. Prediction:
   - Click on the "Predict" button to obtain the results.
   - After prediction, rate your experience on a scale from 1 to 5.

4. Error Handling:
   - In case of any errors, consider refreshing the page.



## About the Prediction Model:

In this project, we have employed a potato disease detection model trained on a diverse array of potato leaf disease images sourced from the **plant_village** dataset and many other datasets combinely we acquired a dataset size of about 10000 images and hence which increases our accuracy pretty much than others.

For an in-depth exploration of the model's inner workings, including its architecture, data preprocessing methodologies, feature extraction techniques, and the model's accuracy, I encourage you to delve into the accompanying Jupyter notebook:

## Results
After training the model using the above techniques we got  training accuracy of **0.9932** and a validation accuracy of **0.9900**
